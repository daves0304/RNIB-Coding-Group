## Summary

Ninite is probably the simplest way to proceed. 

It provides a website frontend with which you can select the software that you would like to install, and wrap them up to be run as a single installer.

This installer can then be run as a single entity on your computer.

Note the Installation of Ninite itself will watch for updates to the software yuo have installed and manage the updates for you.

Although Ninite has a limited about of software available to install, and at the time of writing lacks Jaws as a screen reader, the interface appears to be easy to use.
