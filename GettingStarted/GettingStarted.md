# Getting Started

To get started coding we need to get some software installed on our computer, most notably a compiler and and accessible editor.

Initially it would be sensible to select an arbitrary language and tool set to get started with. For this document it would probably be most usfull to get going wih "Python" using "VsCode" and "NVDA".
- [ ] The decisions to make these selections should be discussed, amended and agreed upon

## Software Installation

There are many ways to get the required software installed on your computer:
1. Download The Software and install it manually. This can be cumbersome to undertake and the installers may not be very accesible.
2. Use a software package manager to install the software. 

## Software Package Managers

At the time of writing there are 2 main options of software package manager that can be used with Windows:
1. Ninite
2. Chocolatey

Each of these will be discussed in there own page.
